"""Anchor-free COCO object detection and bounded detection fine-tuning on the pinned YOLOX-X checkpoint.

The checkpoint is ``yolox_x.pth`` from the upstream GitHub release ``0.1.1rc0`` — YOLOX publishes no
Hugging Face model repository, so provenance here is a release asset URL plus the SHA-256 recorded in
``weights/yolox-x/dimer-base-manifest.json``, not a Hub revision. The model code is vendored from the
upstream repository at a pinned commit (``docs/UPSTREAM.md``); nothing is imported from the ``yolox``
distribution and no remote code is executed.

Two capabilities:

* ``detect`` — the 80 COCO classes, score-ordered xyxy pixel boxes, caller-owned confidence and NMS
  thresholds.
* ``finetune`` — a bounded SimOTA fine-tune onto a caller-supplied class vocabulary, re-heading the
  classification branch and keeping the pretrained backbone, neck, box and objectness weights. The
  result is exportable as a single artifact and reloadable from a fresh process.

Two things about the input pipeline are load-bearing and easy to get wrong:

* **Channel order is BGR.** Upstream reads images with ``cv2.imread`` and feeds the array straight to
  the network — raw 0-255 floats, no ``/255``, no mean/std normalisation (``ValTransform(legacy=False)``).
  Feeding RGB instead degrades detection, and on this variant it does so *quietly*: on this
  repository's own tutorial scene it simply loses the bench and leaves the other three objects'
  scores unchanged to three decimals. The smaller YOLOX-S sibling is much noisier about the same
  mistake, which makes this one easier to ship by accident.
* **The letterbox is reproduced with Pillow, not OpenCV.** Upstream resizes with
  ``cv2.INTER_LINEAR``; this package uses ``PIL.Image.BILINEAR`` so the dependency set stays at torch,
  torchvision, numpy and Pillow. The two kernels are not bit-identical in general, but the resize is
  skipped outright when the input is already ``INPUT_SIZE`` (verified: a Pillow bilinear resize to the
  source size is the identity), so the default 640x640 sample path is unaffected. Only a BYOD image of
  some other size goes through the differing kernel; ``docs/WEIGHTS.md`` records this.

    the threshold; unmatched detections are false positives and unmatched references false negatives.
    Precision is interpolated over 101 recall points, AP is averaged over classes that have at least

    handling, and it scores whatever list it is handed rather than applying the per-image detection
    cap itself (``evaluate`` applies ``MAX_EVAL_DETECTIONS`` before calling in). It must not be

        computes SimOTA matching, the IoU/objectness/classification terms and their weighting. What
        this method owns is the bounded loop around it — the target-tensor conversion, batching, the
        optimiser, the seed and the ceilings. ``use_l1`` stays off: upstream only enables the extra L1
        box term for the last 15 of 300 epochs, and switching it on for a 3-epoch tutorial would
        change the loss scale for no benefit.

        ``freeze_backbone`` (on by default) trains the detection head only and leaves the CSPDarknet
        backbone and PAFPN neck exactly as the COCO checkpoint left them. That is the honest default
        for a bounded tutorial on CPU: it is several times faster per step, it cannot damage the
        pretrained features with a handful of gradient steps on a small set, and the features a
        COCO-trained backbone already has are what makes a few-epoch adaptation work at all. Pass
        ``freeze_backbone=False`` for a full fine-tune when you have the data and the compute for it.
