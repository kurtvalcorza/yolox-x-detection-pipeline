        "to tune and no class softmax — objectness and class probability are independent sigmoids whose product is the score, and per-class NMS "
        "does the rest. At training time the same head runs **SimOTA**: it decides for itself which anchor points should be responsible for which "
        "ground-truth object, by solving a small assignment problem over an IoU-and-classification cost, instead of using a fixed rule.\n\n"
        "That last property is why this notebook can fine-tune a detector in a few minutes on a CPU. **The default path really adapts the model:** "
        "it re-heads YOLOX onto a three-class sign vocabulary that does not exist in COCO, measures a pre-adaptation baseline, runs a bounded "

        "from cells in this notebook, in this runtime.\n\n"

            "below. A CPU runtime is enough. The **Prerequisites** give the details.\n\n"
            "**Running it.** Choose *Runtime → Run all*. The default path needs no edit, no upload, no account, no token and no runtime restart. "

            "in the same runtime reuses it.\n\n"
            "**Where the code runs.** The first two code cells run in the notebook kernel: they build the environment and start one Python process "
            "inside it. Every later cell is sent to that process, so the pinned `torch`, `torchvision` and `numpy` are used without replacing "
            "anything the hosted runtime had already loaded. Printed output, images and errors come back to the notebook as usual, and variables "
            "persist from cell to cell.\n\n"
            "**Two kinds of cell.** *Infrastructure cells* (Sections 1–3: the isolated install and router, the carried package — mostly vendored "
            "upstream YOLOX code — and the pinned-checkpoint staging) are collapsed and labelled **Infrastructure**; you may run them without "
            "studying their implementation. *Learner cells* (Sections 4–13) are the machine-learning workflow.\n\n"
            "**Form controls.** Learner cells start with fields Colab renders as a form: `threshold`, `nms_threshold` (Section 4); `N_IMAGES`, "

For scale: on the repository's Windows CPU venv (Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX) loading takes 4.5 s, one `detect` 0.42 s, and the whole six-epoch fine-tune 130 s. This is the large YOLOX variant — roughly four times the per-image cost of YOLOX-S — so a hosted CPU runtime will be slower still; budget several minutes for the adaptation cell, or attach a GPU. On a Kaggle T4 the previous version of this notebook ran top to bottom in 66.0 s once installed (15 September 2026), after a first pass of 154.5 s that stopped for a restart in the old install cell; this version builds an isolated environment instead and has not been timed yet. The kernel's own Python version does not matter: Section 1 builds a separate **Linux x86_64** environment with CPython 3.12.12 from the hash-locked pins, and every later cell runs there. The Linux build of `torch==2.14.0` with its CUDA libraries (several GB) and the 793 MB checkpoint are the large downloads.",

Optional BYOD is gated off by default. Expected BYOD input: for detection, one image decodable by Pillow, sides 16–4096 px; for adaptation, a directory (`BYOD_DATASET_DIR`, or the files chosen in the upload dialog) holding `annotations.json` — a list of `{'file': 'name.png', 'boxes': [[x0, y0, x1, y1], ...], 'labels': [name, ...]}` objects, boxes in that image's own pixels — and the image files it names, at least 8 records.

        "## Interpretation and limits\n\n"
        "**What this notebook established, in this runtime.** The pinned `yolox_x.pth` release asset was downloaded, digest-verified against a "
        "committed SHA-256 before anything unpickled it, and loaded into YOLOX-X built from vendored upstream code. The pretrained detector "
        "found four of the five drawn COCO objects with per-object IoU 0.918–0.975 in the recorded runs and missed the fifth entirely. A three-class vocabulary "
        "that does not exist in COCO was adapted onto it by a bounded SimOTA fine-tune of the head alone, scored against a held-out split with "
        "COCO-style average precision before and after, run on images from an unseen seed, exported as a single artifact and reloaded from that "
        "artifact to identical scores.\n\n"
        "**What it did not establish.** Nothing here is a benchmark and nothing here is about photographs. Both datasets are drawn in code with "
        "Pillow: flat colours, hard edges, no lighting, no occlusion, no motion blur, no scale variety beyond the jitter the generator applies. "
        "A held-out AP50 of 1.0 on ten images from the same generator says the task is easy and the plumbing works; it is not evidence about real "
        "signs, and the much lower AP@[.50:.95] is the more honest summary — the boxes are right, not tight. Upstream's published 51.5 AP for "
        "YOLOX-X on COCO test-dev is neither reproduced nor checked here, and the average-precision helper carried in Section 2 is a small "
        "faithful implementation without pycocotools' area ranges, crowd handling or official matching, so its numbers are not comparable to "
        "published COCO results.\n\n"
        "**The misses are the useful part.** The drawn football is never proposed as a `sports ball`, and YOLOX-X proposes nothing else on "
        "that box either (the smaller YOLOX-S labels it `kite` and a second `clock`); the evaluation report records a zero rather than "
        "quietly dropping the reference. Earlier probing on the sibling YOLOX-S row found something sharper: a plain white disc with two hands "
        "is not read as a clock at all, and drawing it that way made the *ball* become the clock — the numerals in the sample's clock face are "
        "there because of that, and YOLOX-X reads that face at 0.946 with IoU 0.975. Treat a detector's confidence on rendered graphics as a "
        "statement about rendered graphics.\n\n"
        "**If you adapt this to your own data.** The three defaults that were chosen by measurement will not automatically transfer. The frozen "
        "backbone is right for a few dozen images and a few epochs; with real data and real compute, unfreeze it and lower the learning rate — the "
        "sibling YOLOX-S repository measured a full fine-tune at 1e-3 collapsing to AP 0.0, which is what a too-large step on pretrained features "
        "looks like; the same run has not been made on YOLOX-X. Six "
        "epochs is a tutorial budget, not a recipe. And the thresholds are yours: the demo pair for looking at results, the evaluation pair for "
        "scoring, neither calibrated for anything.\n\n"
        "**What a green run proves.** Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision, the pinned dependency set and the "
        "pinned checkpoint together reproduce these stages in a fresh runtime, without the repository being cloned or installed and without "
        "any DIMER worker or service. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, fitness for any deployment, or that the adapted model "
        "generalises beyond the drawn data it was fitted to.\n\n"
        "**Reproducibility.** Every random choice is seeded — dataset generation, the split, the re-headed classification layers and the training "
        "shuffle — and the seeds are form parameters at the top of their cells. Precision is float32 on CPU and GPU alike; no autocast, no "
        "quantisation, no compiled kernels. Re-running this notebook unchanged in an equivalent runtime should reproduce the numbers; changing "
        "`DATASET_SEED` or `SEED` will change them, which is a useful thing to do once to see how much of the result is the seed.\n\n"
        "## 14. Activity: change one thing — unfreeze the backbone · [Concept]\n\n"
        "Optional; **Predict → Change one thing → Run → Observe → Explain**. It changes nothing unless you do it.\n\n"
        "1. **Predict:** with `FREEZE_BACKBONE = False` the whole network trains at the same learning rate. Will held-out AP rise, stay or "
        "fall? Will the fine-tune take longer?\n"
        "2. **Change:** in Section 8 set `FREEZE_BACKBONE = False`. Change nothing else.\n"
        "3. **Run:** select the Section 8 cell and choose *Runtime → Run after*. Section 8 rebuilds `adapter` from the verified base with the "
        "same seeded head, so this is one clean run with the new setting, not a second run on top of the first. Sections 9–12 overwrite the "
        "artifact and the outputs (download `outputs/` first if you want to keep them).\n"
        "4. **Observe:** Section 9 prints `run_history` with both runs: AP, AP50 and the fine-tune seconds. Compare `num_fg` and the trainable "
        "parameters in Section 8.\n"
        "5. **Explain:** in one sentence, why can training more of a pretrained network make it worse on 30 images?\n\n"
        "<details><summary>Check your reasoning</summary>**This has not been measured on YOLOX-X** — you would be the first to run it, and "
        "on CPU it takes many times longer than the frozen run (130 s on the reference machine), so attach a GPU. The sibling YOLOX-S "
        "repository measured the same change: with the backbone unfrozen at 1e-3 its held-out AP and AP50 collapsed to 0.0, and the run took "
        "about 4.5× longer. A step size that suits a new head is far too large for COCO-pretrained features; a few dozen gradient steps on 30 "
        "drawn images can destroy what the backbone knew, and the head has nothing left to read. Whether the larger X backbone fares better is "
        "exactly what your run tests. With real data you would unfreeze with a much smaller learning rate, and check on a held-out "
        "split, as here.</details>\n\n"
