    "intro": (
        "YOLOX-X is a small anchor-free detector: a CSPDarknet backbone and a PAFPN neck feed a **decoupled head** that emits, at each of "
        "8400 anchor points over a 640×640 letterboxed image, one box, one objectness logit and one logit per class. There are no anchor boxes "
        "to tune and no class softmax — objectness and class probability are independent sigmoids whose product is the score, and per-class NMS "
        "does the rest. At training time the same head runs **SimOTA**: it decides for itself which anchor points should be responsible for which "
        "ground-truth object, by solving a small assignment problem over an IoU-and-classification cost, instead of using a fixed rule.\n\n"
        "That last property is why this notebook can fine-tune a detector in a few minutes on a CPU. **The default path really adapts the model:** "
        "it re-heads YOLOX onto a three-class sign vocabulary that does not exist in COCO, measures a pre-adaptation baseline, runs a bounded "
        "SimOTA fine-tune with the backbone frozen, scores the result against a held-out split it never trained on, runs the adapted model on "
        "unseen images, exports the weights as one artifact and reloads that artifact as if from a cold start. Every number you will see comes "
        "from cells in this notebook, in this runtime.\n\n"
        "Two facts about the input pipeline are load-bearing and the notebook will show you both. Channel order is **BGR**, raw 0–255, with no "
        "`/255` and no mean/std normalisation — that is what upstream feeds the network, and handing it RGB instead measurably degrades detection. "

For scale: on the repository's Windows CPU venv (Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX) loading takes 4.5 s, one `detect` 0.42 s, and the whole six-epoch fine-tune 130 s. This is the large YOLOX variant — roughly four times the per-image cost of YOLOX-S — so a hosted CPU runtime will be slower still; budget several minutes for the adaptation cell, or attach a GPU. The pinned `torch==2.14.0` install and the 793 MB checkpoint are the large downloads.",

Optional BYOD is gated off by default. Expected BYOD input: for detection, one image decodable by Pillow, sides 16–4096 px; for adaptation, a list of `{{'image': PIL.Image, 'boxes': [[x0, y0, x1, y1], ...], 'labels': [name, ...]}}` records with boxes in that image's own pixels.

        "## Interpretation and limits\n\n"
        "**What this notebook established, in this runtime.** The pinned `yolox_x.pth` release asset was downloaded, digest-verified against a "
        "committed SHA-256 before anything unpickled it, and loaded into YOLOX-X built from vendored upstream code. The pretrained detector "
        "found four of the five drawn COCO objects with per-object IoU around 0.91–0.96 and missed the fifth entirely. A three-class vocabulary "
        "that does not exist in COCO was adapted onto it by a bounded SimOTA fine-tune of the head alone, scored against a held-out split with "
        "COCO-style average precision before and after, run on images from an unseen seed, exported as a single artifact and reloaded from that "
        "artifact to identical scores.\n\n"
        "**What it did not establish.** Nothing here is a benchmark and nothing here is about photographs. Both datasets are drawn in code with "
        "Pillow: flat colours, hard edges, no lighting, no occlusion, no motion blur, no scale variety beyond the jitter the generator applies. "
        "A held-out AP50 of 1.0 on ten images from the same generator says the task is easy and the plumbing works; it is not evidence about real "
        "signs, and the much lower AP@[.50:.95] is the more honest summary — the boxes are right, not tight. Upstream's published 51.5 AP for "
        "YOLOX-X on COCO test-dev is neither reproduced nor checked here, and the average-precision helper carried in Section 2 is a small "
        "faithful implementation without pycocotools' area ranges, crowd handling or official matching, so its numbers are not comparable to "
        "published COCO results.\n\n"
        "**The misses are the useful part.** The drawn football is never proposed as a `sports ball`; the model offers `kite` and a second `clock` "
        "on that box instead, and the evaluation report records a zero rather than quietly dropping the reference. Earlier probing found "
        "something sharper: a plain white disc with two hands is not read as a clock at all, and drawing it that way made the *ball* become the "
        "clock — the numerals in the sample's clock face are there because of that. Treat a detector's confidence on rendered graphics as a "
        "statement about rendered graphics.\n\n"
        "**If you adapt this to your own data.** The three defaults that were chosen by measurement will not automatically transfer. The frozen "
        "backbone is right for a few dozen images and a few epochs; with real data and real compute, unfreeze it and lower the learning rate — the "
        "repository measured a full fine-tune at 1e-3 collapsing to AP 0.0, which is what a too-large step on pretrained features looks like. Six "
        "epochs is a tutorial budget, not a recipe. And the thresholds are yours: the demo pair for looking at results, the evaluation pair for "
        "scoring, neither calibrated for anything.\n\n"
        "**What a green run proves.** Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision, the pinned dependency set and the "
        "pinned checkpoint together reproduce these stages in a fresh runtime, without the repository being cloned or installed and without "
        "any DIMER worker or service. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, fitness for any deployment, or that the adapted model "
        "generalises beyond the drawn data it was fitted to.\n\n"
        "**Reproducibility.** Every random choice is seeded — dataset generation, the split, the re-headed classification layers and the training "
        "shuffle — and the seeds are form parameters at the top of their cells. Precision is float32 on CPU and GPU alike; no autocast, no "
        "quantisation, no compiled kernels. Re-running this notebook unchanged in an equivalent runtime should reproduce the numbers; changing "
        "`DATASET_SEED` or `SEED` will change them, which is a useful thing to do once to see how much of the result is the seed.\n\n"
